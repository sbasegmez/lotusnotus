Dear IBM,

I have implemented a number of Lotus Notes Traveler configurations so far. My customers don't call me second time. It just works.
<!-- more -->
Now we are testing Android support. I should say that the first impressions are great.

I think this is the first Lotus product ever, which does not need a aftersales support :) Please don't change any developer in this project. You should also give them extra bonus for their efforts.

Just for the records, there are cool features may be added in the future...

- My customers are asking for scheduled replication. There are some users, don't want to use push mail for a couple of reasons like battery life.
- Detected some issues in LMC integration. VPN integration may be expanded in the future.
- Multiple account monitoring (like in Commontime mSuite)

Sure, more wishlist will be aggregated here, by comments...

Thanks again, IBM. Traveler is a great product...
