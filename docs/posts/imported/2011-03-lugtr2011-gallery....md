I am collecting photos and videos taken in the conference. Julian and Manfred provided some and here they are :)

About videos, I used a Sony HD camera for recording sessions. In a limited time, we failed to test light conditions. Video quality is extremely low. There were also problems with the sound. For example Uffe's speech has been soundless :(

I am still extracting videos and uploading them into youtube. It is a long process but I will share them soon... If you have any materials, please send to me :)

First of all, photos... If you can't see it, please click [here](http://yfrog.com/gzaqd6jx)... (It does not work on Chrome I think. Shame on YFrog!)
