Two weeks ago, at a round table meeting with Kevin Cavanaugh, I saw Traveler working on his iPad... Few days later [Ed Brill](http://www.edbrill.com "Ed Brill") [blogged about it](http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/lotus-notes-traveler-on-the-ipad-now-supported). IBMers are 'officially' using Lotus Notes Traveler on iPad...

Ed also has good news about more. Starting with 8.5.2, some new features will be included to the codestream regarding iPad usability.
