The quality of entries were significantly higher this time. There are impressing projects and judgement was very tough this year...

[Mark](http://www.hughesconnect.com/) absolutely deserved the golden medal with his great mobile application...

The name in the first finalist is also funny (and shocking) for me. [Ferhat Bulut](http://bestcoder.net/) is my friend, the other co-leader of LUGTR and my neighbour (yes! we are living 50 meters away to each other)... Honestly, in our long tweeting dialog before the results, I had told Ferhat that he may not have a chance for the first three. But I was wrong again :)

[Tim Tripcony](http://www.timtripcony.com/), the xmage has also contributed with his [watrcoolr](http://watrcoolr.info/) application. Download this app... It is a piece of art in XPage programming... The only reason it is not in the first three would be that it was a bit premature for the moment.

There are great projects in the [list](http://xpages.info/contest). Go download them and learn more about XPages. But please follow the licensing rules and credit the developer (and shout their names) if you are using any open source...
