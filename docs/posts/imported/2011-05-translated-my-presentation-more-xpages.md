This is [Learn XPages Month](http://xpages.info/Internal/home.nsf/dx/Learn-XPages-Month)!

So I translated slides of my recent session in Social Business Roadshow Istanbul 2011... Don't expect too much. This is an introductory session for upcoming workshops planned in Turkish LUG.
<!-- more -->
I am putting this here because of two reasons. First, Cristian D'Aloisio ([dominobaloney.com](http://www.dominobaloney.com/)) requested :) Second, I wanted to contribute if anyone needs an introductory outline for a session targeting newbie XPage developers...

You may use, modify and distribute this. Just be nice and respect the credits at the last slide because I somehow used or inspired of information from those people.

Here is the link to the [ODP](http://www.developi.com/presentations/SBRS2011/SBRS2011_XPages_English.odp) file...
