Yes! It is Dexter and No! Our topic is XPages, not Dexter :)
<!-- more -->
I've been in CEE Regional Lotus Partners Summit for the last two days. I've seen so many interesting things that I cannot share publicly (or privately). Probably I'm not the first person who have seen those plans and I guess LA attendants last week know more than me.

Anyway, since I declared not to share anything, many of my readers would not read this post until this point... For the rest; I can tell you I will share one thing:

**XPages...**

At the opening session, we saw some figures. That was quite unexpected for an IBM meeting but let me tell you; Relatively small fraction of revenue comes from IBM Connections and most of the revenue in our region still belongs to Notes/Domino products. However, 90% of the entire meeting was reserved by IBM Connections.

It is also interesting that if somebody told me so, before I bought my plane tickets; I would probably cancel my ticket because I have been extremely depressed to hear three things:

1. Social Business
2. Number of Turkish/XXXish users in Facebook
3. Social Business (did I say it before?)

Yes! I admit it... I didn't get this Social Business thing yet. My Turkish readers know why... To sum up, I don't really see a short-term future for our market. It's not about IBM, Microsoft or Connections; instead, there is a mismatch between the new strategy, Turkish market structure and our business culture. That doesn't mean you cannot sell Connections in Turkey. IBM is about to close some great deals and if they succeed, planetlotus.org will be talking about Turkey :) As I blogged several times before, Social Business can only be aggregated in Turkey by traditional market development techniques, like consultancy triage, **Institutionalism** or functionality tricks (selling Portal to HR)... It's also the leader in its field and comparing Connections to the 'so-called' competitor (Sharepoint) is another topic...

But I'm really satisfied with the whole conference. I will blog some insights in the future.

On the other hand, 10% of the meeting was not about XPages at all, but I still insist on XPages.

Uffe Sorensen and [Ed Brill](http://www.edbrill.com "Ed Brill") demoed some future directions for Notes/Domino family. I wish those were ready to go public. But from what they showed, I can say that XPages has a great future, not only with LOB applications, but also with the social transformation of collaboration environments in all terms.

So here are the keywords which developers should immediately learn and get ready until the second half of 2012...

- Extension Library and especially the latest release of Social Enabler...
- XPages Extensibility...
- REST API...
- OpenSocial...

Goto [XPages.info](http://www.xpages.info/) and start to change your career...

A note to traditional domino developers. I don't mean you don't have a future :) Notes will be supporting those applications for a long time. We will be running and developing classical applications in the future because of some architectural restrictions. But if you are interested in extending your skills, XPages is still the right way...

To sum up: "Tick tick tick..."
