**Submissions for Session Abstracts** are open. Submission form can be downloaded from [here](http://filez.lotusturkiye.org/conf2011/cfa_en.zip)...

* ZIP file includes ODF (for Symphony 3) and PDF formats.
* If you are not using appropriate version of Acrobat Reader, you would not be able to save your form information.
* I have tested ODF file with an older version of Symphony. There may be a problem with editing multiline textboxes. If so, just delete the textbox and fill in the table cell :)
