I like Google Chrome. I see many bloggers prefer Chrome and Firefox. An important amount of my visitors also use Chrome and Firefox. IBM is officially using Firefox for sometime.

Regarding Chrome, many products and pages (including Lotus iNotes, Lotus Live, XPages, PartnerWorld, GPP etc.) are not officially supporting Google Chrome browser.

Dear IBM, we really love Chrome and expect the same compassion from the Big Blue :)
