This June has been declared as the '**Learn XPages Month** '. It doesn't mean that we will sit and wait for you until you learn it well :)
<!-- more -->
This month, we are going to **participate into discussion** ! It doesn't matter how much you know... Because even asking a question into a forum or making a comment into any blog entry will help somebody else.

As Turkish LUG, we will also be trying to organize a workshop this month. Many companies will have discounts next month. Bloggers (including myself) will also blog more about XPages.

So, I am calling all non-contributing silent geeks! It is the "**Learn XPages Month** "...

Niklas has created a page under xpages.info... Spread the word out...
