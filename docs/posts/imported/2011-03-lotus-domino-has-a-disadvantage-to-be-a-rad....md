Certainly...

Let me explain why...

Oh my god! 618 MB means that I can download it in 105 minutes by my humble ADSL connection!

Ooops.. I need a faster RAD tool... Let me look at the closest rival of IBM. Maybe they have a faster solution.

Hey, I found it... They named it as ASP.NET MVC... I don't know what it is. I never heard of it. But it used some buzzwords like model, view, controller... It must be a good solution. Let me open it...

Now I am relieved. It is so small that I can download it less than 5 minutes.

Rapid application development tool should be such rapid!

I finally found the right tool to develop my enterprise applications for my enterprise customers in less than 5 minutes. According to what I read, even my baby can develop application using this. I am so impatient to suggest it to my customers. Think about it. It really decreases your customers' TCO. There are hosting services $1 per month with 20GB storage. I can market this as a cloud-ready framework. Cool...

This was a good benchmarking for rapid application development...
