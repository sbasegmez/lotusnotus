A second suggestion to IBM. They should acquire [Snapps](http://www.snapps.com/). At least, [Rob Novak](http://www.lotusrockstar.com/) should be included in a payroll :)

I think that this fantastic team has leveraged the market value of Lotus Quickr up to another level...
<!-- more -->
I am using Lotus Quickr for a some years. Although it is useful and well-designed tool, you cannot discover how much you can bend it according to your needs. A bare implementation is just another web 2.0 tool...

Then I noticed some guys, designing interesting place types for specific issues. Utilitization of Snapps templates is not the core issue. The most important thing they provided to us is that they can bend the spoon :)

Excellent point is that they provide most of the templates free of charge, as beer...

Dear Snapps, I know you work hard, but we need your templates to be compatible with Quickr 8.5.1.

and...

Dear IBM, please acquire Snapps :)

###### P.S. Not an original idea :) Inspired by [Stuart McIntyre](http://quickrblog.com/)...
