Yes! Change is good...

For a couple of weeks, I've been working on Bootstrap and as I learn it, my blog became a great playground for me!
<!-- more -->
It's still using Domino Blog template at the back-end but skin is completely renewed. I have not optimized for performance yet but I can tell you, our blog template is so powerful that I have not changed anything in the application design!

Please share your thoughts and tell me if you see any problems!

*BTW, I can share my templates in case you want to use on your own blog. Just drop me a note...*

**Note from the future**: As you might guess, I moved my blog away now. You can still see my old blog design on the [Internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250113202946/https://lotusnotus.com/), and also other blogs that used my design (hopefully, Darren's blog is still there).
