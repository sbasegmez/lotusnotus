Minutes ago, [Ed Brill](http://www.edbrill.com "Ed Brill") blogged about '[Domino as a rapid application development](http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/ibm.com-whitepaper-on-domino-as-a-rapid-application-development-platform)'... Moreover, he announced that "***The Notes/Domino application development product management mission is in my area of responsibility as of 1/1/11*** ".

Stuart McIntyre first [blogged about a published whitepaper](http://collaborationmatters.com/blog/cmblog.nsf/dx/ibm-releases-new-thought-leadership-white-paper-on-development-platforms-showcasing...-lotus-domino) last month. I have posted an [entry](2010-12-so-ibm-is-marketing-lotus-domino-as-a-radd....md "so-ibm-is-marketing-lotus-domino-as-a-radd....htm") last week, ended with this sentence: "***I will not 'hurray' this but I am so grateful and hopeful it will be continued...*** "

Now I can 'hurray!' to this. It means a lot.

You know, [Ed Brill](http://www.edbrill.com "Ed Brill") is the most important social media figure of Lotus Software. He blogs, talks and participates community events all over the world. IBM uses "Notes/Domino", "application development" and "product management" phrases in the same business card and gives it to Ed.

Am I daydreaming or that would be underlined as "IBM is positioning Domino as an application development product and giving its responsibility to a forefront senior manager!"...

Now you're talking :)
