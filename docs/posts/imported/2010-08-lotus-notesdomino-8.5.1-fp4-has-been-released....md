IBM announced that Lotus Notes/Domino 8.5.1 FP4 packages are ready to be downloaded. The fix pack contains several critical fixes and is recommended for all 8.5.1 users. It is also incremental and contains all fixes in prior fix-packs. I didn't have time to look at the list of fixes but I'll blog about them soon.

Fix list contained by FP4 can be seen on:
