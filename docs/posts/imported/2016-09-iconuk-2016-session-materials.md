Here are the session materials from ICONUK 2016.
<!-- more -->
Firstly, in the Administration track, "**Back from the Dead: When Bad Code Kills a Good Server** " session with my great co-speaker Bill Malchisky:

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="97e336a2e4564e3497c2a45b2abe5d45" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

The second session was my solo show, "**REST Assured, Freeing Your Domino Data Has Never Been That Easy!** ":

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="9995b8fbeb344554861f879b63cd7396" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

You can also download [the Apache Wink demo and the template plugin](https://github.com/sbasegmez/RestAssuredDemo) I have promised from my Github page. Refer to the [Readme page](https://github.com/sbasegmez/RestAssuredDemo/blob/master/README.md) for the guide to install and configure.

I hope you like it. Have fun :)
