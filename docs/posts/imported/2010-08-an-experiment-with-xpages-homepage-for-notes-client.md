One of my customers requested their Lotus Notes homepage to be revised. There are so many ideas that we cannot wait for Project Vulcan :)
<!-- more -->
After a small brain storming, we decided to investigate any opportunities to **design Lotus Notes homepage database with XPages** ...

I tried to set an XPage as homepage but it failed. Then, an idea came in...

**I designed a composite application which contains a couple of XPages and it can be configured as a Home Page!**

Anyone tried that before? It seems to be loading slow at the beginning but seems to be useable...
