News about upcoming release 8.5.2 are becoming more clear. Last week, Lotus team shared some possible improvements about iNotes 8.5.2 in Open Mic event.

* There will be some **performance improvements** editing (New, Reply, Forward, etc.) messages.
* **Sametime 8.5 integration** will be added (Meeting support from calendar, web awareness, chat, contact list and business card integration). However, some features will be tech-preview.
* New messages will be blocked when **over quota**.
* Users will have ability to **mark subject as confidential**.
* Ultra-light theme will be available in **Android on Google Nexus One**. Droid access is being evaluated.
* Interface will be **bidi-enabled**.
* My favorite one: There will be an **MSI package for iNotes Web Controls** (at last!)
* **Lotus Live Notes Integration** will be available.

Of course, no need to remind that these improvements are in progress for development. They are not guaranteed yet.
