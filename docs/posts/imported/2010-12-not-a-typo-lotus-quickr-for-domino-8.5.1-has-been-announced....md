Yesterday we got news about a fixpack for Quickr for Domino 8.5.

Today Stuart posted a [blog entry about Lotus Quickr 8.5.1 announcement](http://quickrblog.com/blog/quickrblog.nsf/dx/lotus-quickr-8.5.1-now-available). At first I suspected a typo and opened the link to comment but shame on me :)))
<!-- more -->
The official announcement is [here](http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=877&letternum=ENUSZP10-0551).

It will be available on December 16, 2010...

The most significant issues referred are:

* Support for Domino Off-Line Services, which enables users to create a copy of a Quickr Place on their local machine, make changes to the local copy without a network connection, and then synchronize changes on the server when reconnected to the network (Microsoft® Windows® users only).
* Availability of Hebrew and Arabic national language versions so now all national languages are supported.
* Import and export support for Microsoft Excel 2007 formatted files into the new "List" feature for structured content. Lists were first introduced in Lotus Quickr 8.5 for Domino.
* Easy, direct upgrade process from Lotus Quickr for Domino 8.1, 8.2, and 8.5.
* Support for Lotus Connections 3.
* Support for Lotus Sametime® 8.5.1.

<br />

BTW, about the first part (off-line support): You gotta be kidding... I didn't realize they lifted DOLS support on 8.5 :)
