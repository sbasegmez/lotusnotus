I just read Ed's post, "[GBS and IBM hosting Application Development Workshops](http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/gbs-and-ibm-hosting-application-development-workshops)" which reminds me our latest project within Turkish Lotus User Group...

As you may know, we recently created a little team inside LUGTR and we are planning some activities targeting university students with coordination of IBM Academic Initiative. Our primary aim is te raise brand awareness within these students.

We are currently discussing about organizing series of technical workshops for senior students. XPages seems like a very good idea for such a workshop. We are going to present students how easy to develop fancy applications with XPages.

I blogged about this issue because we need some inputs about it. The easy way is to use a usual proof of technology workshop in the class; everything is ready, no need to deal with the content anyway. But I have some doubts on efficiency. PoT workshop is targeting developers with the former Notes/Domino development background. So it would be very bad idea to use it on people never heard anything about Lotus.

I am waiting for your inputs about it. What could a student workshop include? We should go with an outline or attractive scenerio for participants?

If anyone seen or heard of a similar activity, please contact me. It would be extremely useful.
