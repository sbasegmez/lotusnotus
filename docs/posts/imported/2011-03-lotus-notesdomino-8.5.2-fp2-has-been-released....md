IBM announced that Lotus Notes/Domino 8.5.2 FP2 packages are ready to be downloaded. The fix pack contains several critical fixes and is recommended for all 8.5.2 users.
<!-- more -->
Preliminary fix list contained by FP2 can be seen on:

There are a couple of improvements in this release, such as syntax validation in recent contacts, managed replicas, 'Save as EML' feature, etc.

To download FP2, you can use [Fix Central](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/). I have generated a list of all available fixes for [Notes](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm~Lotus&product=ibm/Lotus/Lotus+Notes&release=8.5.2.0&platform=All&function=recommended&source=fc) and [Domino](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm~Lotus&product=ibm/Lotus/Lotus+Domino&release=8.5.2.0&platform=Windows&function=all&source=fc)... Parts are not yet available on Passport Advantage as I posted this entry.
