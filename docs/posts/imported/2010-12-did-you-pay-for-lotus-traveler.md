OK, the subject is false... Lotus Traveler is a free product for Lotus Domino Servers. But there is a small detail to be evaluated.

You are not using express licensing. You have several server PVU licenses for your servers and you want to install a seperate Traveler Server.

Since Traveler server code will be installed on top of Lotus Domino Server, now the question comes in: Do I need an additional Domino Server PVUs for this seperate server?

I had this question a lot. As a matter of fact, I am exposed licensing questions very often, because there are very limited resources about licensing on ibm.com web sites. BTW, you should read my [](2010-11-exceptionally-annoying-web-experience-ibm.com-navigation-contest....md "exceptionally-annoying-web-experience-ibm.com-navigation-contest....htm")blog entry about navigation contest if you are ready to search ibm.com :)

I asked this issue to our channel team and got an answer. I checked with the license document and there was no explicit expression about it.

Answer is YES! You will need an extra PVU license for your seperate server.

On the other hand, a similar situation is with Sametime Limited edition. If your seperate server has a unique function of Sametime chats and presence; the scenerio is the same.

However, there is a conflict here. I am not good at legal documents but as far as I understood, it seems that you don't need a seperate license for limited edition. It needs clarification though...
Regarding general issues, after a small chat with local IBM and region, they decided to organize a small session for kick-off partner meeting about licensing. I will continue to blog about licensing...

Meanwhile, you may reach licensing documents through the following link (if don't link contests)...
