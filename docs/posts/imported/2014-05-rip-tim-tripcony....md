As many friends around, we are shocked and deeply saddened by unexpected loss of our own Tim Tripcony.

Tim Tripcony was one of the most talented developers I have met... He inspired all of us by challenging all kinds of limits in our platform and finding really elegant patterns in various problems. He was always polite, helpful and positive with people.

RIP, my friend. You'll be missed a lot.
