I personally think that Microsoft has overpaid Skype and it won't return that much profit in tangible or intangible quantities.
<!-- more -->
However, I think it's time to connect Skype to Sametime Gateway product. Considering lots of SMBs are using Skype, it will be a benefit.

IBM has a strategy to make its products compatible with different competitors' technology. On the other hand, I hear what IBM will say. There are technical problems and uncertainity about the future of Skype. But I just needed to say this :)

I will demand more! GTalk and Skype integration has to be extended to cover voice and video calls :)

Just a thought...
