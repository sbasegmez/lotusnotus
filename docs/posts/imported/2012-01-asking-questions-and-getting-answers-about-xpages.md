Today, this issue came up by a simple question: Do we need a Skype Chat for beginner level XPages developers?

If you are using Skype persistent chats, you would know their problems:
<!-- more -->
1. They are distracting.
2. They don't have search and memory.
3. They are not public.

So the discussion has moved over twitter...

First of all, my personal thoughts:

There is a great wall around XPages preventing newcomers. I am not talking about documentation or learning stuff. There are tons of it. I'm talking about questions and answers here.

Think about a rookie developer trying to learn XPages. He has only one address to go: [xpages.info](http://xpages.info/). There are tons of videos, samples and similar resources there. But when our rookie guy starts programming, there would be a great issue. There isn't any effective platform where you ask your questions...

But there is an XPages forum... It lacks some important features. We'll come to that...

Let's define 'effective'...

Think about a streaming discussion, like a chat. People ask questions on this persistent chat and get answers from listeners. Let's put some gamification to that. Authors of right answers would get some scoring. People would 'like' the answer and promote the contributor. It should be searchable and followable.

This can be achieved with a number of additions to [watrcoolr](http://watrcoolr.info/), developed by [Tim Tripcony](http://timtripcony.com/) for the latest OpenNTF contest. It would be something between watrcoolr and IQJam.

Somehow, another alternative came up with [Bruce Elgort's tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/belgort/status/161853463934926848): "***I wish more XPages developers would start using StackOverflow*** "

That sparked a discussion and instantly, many XPagers [attacked to StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=xpages), asking and replying questions...

A customized watrcoolr would be extremely useful but comparing to StackOverflow, there are some negative points:

- It needs lots of development.
- It needs to be hosted (OpenNTF? IBM?)
- It needs to be managed and maintained (any volunteers?)
- It's inside the bubble... Only WE, people following xpages.info or planetlotus.org will be able to see it.

Whereas;

- Stackoverflow is ready. No need to manage or maintain. Go and use it.
- It has a great API. We may utilize it to embed our community sites to promote unresolved questions and contributors.
- It's outside the bubble. It's open to thousands of JS, Java and JSF experts. XPages technology needs some visibility around the globe.

What is wrong with the XPages forum?

- Around thousand issues not resolved yet.
- It's still inside bubble, hidden somewhere in developerWorks.
- Contribution is not directly promoted.
- It's not responsive and followable (no e-mail notification, limited RSS support, no site integration)

I am not suggesting abondoning XPages Forum. Either use an enhanced watrcooler or StackOverflow; it has to remain connected to XPages Forum. This forum will still be an entry point for many intermediate and advanced level questions. More importantly, XPages forum will be hosting XPages discussions. Because both ways will not provide a discussion platform and we still need that.

I want to hear more opinions about this. Which method will be more effective according to you?

1. XPages Forum
2. Enhanced version of watrcoolr
3. StackOverflow

If you also think StackOverflow is a meaningful platform to go; many XPagers (including me) started working on some basic widgets for SO.
