Back from Engage!

Again, it was an incredible user group conference! Thanks to **Theo** , **Hilde** and all others helping to the team, we had fantastic time with so many friends for a couple of days. There has been so much things to be said, but I'll use the advantage of late blogging: Many friends blogged/tweeted/posted a lot of stuff on every moment of the conference :)

This year, I spoke for an Admin session for the first time (at least for such conferences). Many friends would know me about my humble work on XPages stuff, but I am an *half-blood* Domino admin in my real life, of course with eyeglasses and a hat! :)

Still, I had the developer role in the session but it has been a different session in a way that we had no code on any slides! That has not been the case ever for me :)

Me and my co-speaker, a great admin and the master of Linux, Bill Malchisky presented a real life story...

> It's Friday and a new customer calls. Their mission critical app is taking :05 to open documents and the users are quite concerned. Where do you start when handed a 20 year old application you have never seen, on a server you barely know? Join two IBM Champions as they dissect a complex Domino performance problem from both the administration and development side to provide a complete customer solution. The session includes best practices around problem solving techniques and a checklist you can use internally to solve quickly problems you encounter
