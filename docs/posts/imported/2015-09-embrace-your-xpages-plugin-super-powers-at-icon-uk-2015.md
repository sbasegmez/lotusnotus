I'm almost ready for my session, "**How to Embrace Your XPages Plugin Super Powers** ".

> Using Java in your XPages applications gives you 'super powers'. Developers can use these Java super powers to fight even the most complex beast of an application. But some superheros frequently resort to copying and pasting libraries between applications. It's time for you to embrace new development super powers! This session will equip you with the skills and techniques you will need. We will first start by covering the basics of plugins. And then, we will move on to look into some first-hand experiences and best practices to overcome difficulties. As a bonus, you will see how to develop and reuse the same artifacts across different applications and different runtimes (e.g. DOTS, Servlets, External applications, etc). Start building your very own extension library and concentrate our applications instead of utilities.

<br />

Come over, if you want to know how to start plugin development for IBM Domino environments and challenges to expect. It's at 11:50 on Monday, Room 2 :)
