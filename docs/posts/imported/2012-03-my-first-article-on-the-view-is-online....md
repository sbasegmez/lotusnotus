My first article "[**Custom Controls --- Basic Concepts and Techniques for Getting Started**](http://bit.ly/wZfzib)" has been published on [The View](http://www.eview.com/) magazine.

This is the beginning of a series of articles about custom controls. In the first part, I have focused on differences between custom controls and subforms, basic usage of custom control properties and some features around reusability. You may follow the link above to read the article if you are subscribed to The View magazine.

I have been blogging for more than two years now. For 90% of my posts, I am writing bilingual, which is not so easy for me. Although I studied undergraduate and graduate in English, blogging in another language is much harder than course project for sure.

But writing technical articles for real publication is much more difficult than blogging. My respect to book-writers has been tripled these days.

As a rookie writer, I'd like to thank my editor, Celeste Frey especially because of her great patience...
