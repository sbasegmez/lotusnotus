It happened again...

I was dealing with a Sametime 8.5.2 IFR1 upgrade today at the client site. I had this annoying error while upgrading Media Manager: "Not enough storage is available to process this command"
<!-- more -->
I googled and browsed to [my blog entry](2011-07-one-week-of-ibm-lotus-sametime-8.5.2-experiences....md "one-week-of-ibm-lotus-sametime-8.5.2-experiences....htm").

This is a very common story for many bloggers. Some of us keeping blog as a personal memory. The only difference from others, we can use Google for our own notebooks :)

BTW, I couldn't solve my issue this time. Because, in fact, I didn't explain the solution in my blog entry. The problem is related to Java and the heap size. You can solve it by increasing heap size. Explained in the following technote:
