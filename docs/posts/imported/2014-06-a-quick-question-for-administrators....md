Just a quick question.

Especially large domains have lots of users with the same full name. In modern directory systems, we can decrease the possibility of conflict by using hierarchical naming, however that will become an issue eventually, when you need to specify an e-mail address. I have seen that adding a number to the first or last name (John Smith , John 1 Smith, etc.) is highly popular.

How do you handle people with the same name in your environment (e.g. Domino, AD, Connections, etc.)?
