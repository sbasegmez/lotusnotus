#6: [Lotus Domino Administrators: It's time to delegate your mess...](2010-07-lotus-domino-administrators-its-time-to-delegate-your-mess....md "Lotus Domino Administrators: It’s time to delegate your mess...")
I inspired this topic at a customer meeting. My customer contact was a Lotus Domino administrator but also responsible from network security, mobile phones and VMs as well! Several friends assisted me about automating admin tasks with their comments.

#5: [XPages problems after 8.5.2 upgrade!](2010-09-xpages-problems-after-8.5.2-upgrade.md "XPages problems after 8.5.2 upgrade!")
I saw this problem at a customer. We could not solve the issue and said: "Let's post an entry to your blog!". At the end of the day, we solved the issue. Blog community responded faster than the support team :)

#4: [My first XPages application: The good, the bad and the ugly sides of XPages](2010-08-my-first-xpages-application-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-sides-of-xpages.md "My first XPages application: The good, the bad and the ugly sides of XPages")
I have designed my first XPages application as a subscription module for this blog. I had some training before and I was sure to handle it. However I could not! Dealing with a couple of simple problems (now they seem simple) for hours... XPages told me: "It is inevitable, Mr. Anderson..." :)

#3: [Lotus Notes 8.5.2 will start faster...](2010-06-lotus-notes-8.5.2-will-start-faster....md "Lotus Notes 8.5.2 will start faster...")
This is a '**forward blog** '. I want to clarify this issue! You know people forwarding every single e-mail to his friends, not considering if others care. There are blogger versions of these 'forward spammers'. I see some blogs that 70% of their posts are pasted from someone else's blog. Sometimes they don't even give a damned link.

When I look at the planetlotus.org, I feel I might be doing the same thing. Believe me, I try not to do! In some cases, I get some news (e.g. a new product announcement) and post it to my blog without looking others. But most of the time, I am aware of someone else posted a similar one. The reason is that I am writing bilingual. So if I write a topic in Turkish, I often translate it to English to preserve my consistency. I always try hard to give a reference link if I saw another blog entry... I noticed this issue recently and I am open to corrections here.

#2: [Lotus Notes/Domino 8.5.2 is coming: A blogroll wrap-up...](2010-04-lotus-notesdomino-8.5.2-is-coming-a-blogroll-wrap-up....md "Lotus Notes/Domino 8.5.2 is coming: A blogroll wrap-up...")
This is a type of entry I want to do more. On hot issues, different bloggers take different sides, express different opinions. After a while, a reader may be lost in this pool... I wanted to summarize 8.5.2 improvements with references from the yellow bubble.

and finally, the oscar goes to:

#1: [](2010-03-id-vault-uploaddownload-problems.md "ID Vault Upload/Download Problems")ID Vault Upload/Download Problems
A large customer asked me to implement ID Vault feature, I created a test platform with different servers and clients. After some tests, I noticed that there are a number of important problems in older versions. I summarized issues and their workarounds in this entry. I am still getting new issues but can't find time to aggregate. By the way, the original post was in Turkish. After a guy commented and asked me to translate, I decided to translate some posts to English. Now I am blogging bilingual :)))

The distribution indicated interesting trends for my blog... First of all, the most popular topic of this year may be selected as '**Lotus Notes/Domino 8.5.2** '... Nearly all my posts about 8.5.2 are in top-ten list. XPages is another popular topic. Two of top-5 are about XPages as you see.

However the most interesting case was the golden medal post. I can warn Lotus Support team about that: ID Vault issues are really common. Please do something :)))

#### Disappointment of 2010

I worked hard for my 'Corporate Social Software' series. They had very little popularity despite of the time I spent. I don't know why... any opinion?
