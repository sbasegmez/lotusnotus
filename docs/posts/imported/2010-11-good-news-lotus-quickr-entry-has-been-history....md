I found that Lotus Quickr Entry 8.5 does not exist on the passport advantage. It has been discontinued quietly (I could not find any announcement about it).

Hey, calm down, it is not that bad, because, according to rumors (!), a better replacement is on the way...

Two years ago, it started with a speculation that excited everyone which stated that Quickr Entry, limited edition, to be released and entitled for every Domino users. Quickr Entry was not so valued product according to me. People expected a personal document management utility. However it only provided a simple way to share large personal files without e-mails. It's useful for specific cases but no categorization, no tagging, no commenting or no versioning? Better than nothing at all ? :)

Now, Lotus Domino entitlement provides Lotus Quickr Entry 8.2 version only...

I am surprised that no one ever mentioned about it. I googled and searched for planetlotus.org and ibm.com and could not find any details.

Anyway, a replacement product (hopefully better one) is on the way... Stay tuned :)
