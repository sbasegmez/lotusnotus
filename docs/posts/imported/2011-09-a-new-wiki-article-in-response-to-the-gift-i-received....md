On thursday, I have received a very cool gift package from [Jim Casale](http://www.jimcasale.net/) because of my [Wikimania](http://www.wikimania.us/) participation...

Unfortunately, the IBM mug wasn't lucky enough for this long travel but other gifts are cool! Especially I am very glad about my hard copy of "Mastering XPages" book. This will be the first book on my shelf in the new office :)

I thought about it and I decided that returning a simple "Thank you" will not be enough!

Therefore, I created a new wiki article named "[Do's and Do Not's for XPages Scoped Variables](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/ddwiki.nsf/dx/Dos_and_Do_Nots_for_XPages_Scoped_Variables)" in return of this gift. It is based on my recent blog about [XPages and serialization issue](2011-08-serialization-viewscope-and-exploding-xpage-after-upgrade....md).

I am hoping to extend this article in the future with your valuable comments. I would like to have more details about performance issues especially.

Thank you Jim for the Wikimania contest, David and Tim for their contributions into the article.

Now I'm thinking what I may do after receiving my IBM Champions package :)
