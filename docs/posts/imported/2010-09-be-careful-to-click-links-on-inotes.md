The image below is taken from my blog's stats database. It shows referrer information of my visitors.

As you see, the user clicked a link from his/her iNotes screen to reach my blog page. The situation creates a security breach. I have some information about the visitor like where s/he is working and what his/her name may be. A small linkedin/facebook search may provide more info, enough for some social engineering...

For some reason, I cannot login to ideajam. I'd be happy if someone creates a suggestion to fix it.
