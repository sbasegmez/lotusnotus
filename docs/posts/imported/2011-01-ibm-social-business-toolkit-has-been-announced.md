At the grand opening today, IBM Social Business Toolkit has been announced.

IBM was playing in Social Software arena for a while. But looking at every product they released, lots of ideas pop up in my mind about how we use it, how our customers get advantage from it, etc... Coming into reality, these are all useless if we cannot integrate them with our current applications...

[Social business toolkit](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/ibmsocialbusinesstoolkit/index.html)is what we need! It provides a set of tools that **enable developers to publish and retrieve events to the activity stream** of the aggregation service. The toolkit further enables cloud deployability, open standards-based APIs to consume, produce, and use events, a configurable adapter framework for consuming existing external content, filtering capabilities, and enhanced administrative features for better security.

You may find more examples on the [wiki home of social business toolkit](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpViewCategories.xsp?lookupName=IBM%20Social%20Business%20Toolkit)...

Activity stream is an important concept here. It is the core part of new social software technology. Read [this](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/dx/Introducing_Phase_1_Activity_streams_and_event_aggregation_sbt) to understand what it is and how you can see a testing environment...

Of course, it is not necessary to mention that XPages will be the gateway for us, Domino developers...
