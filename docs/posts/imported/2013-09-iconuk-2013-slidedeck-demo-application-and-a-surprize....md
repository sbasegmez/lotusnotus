ICONUK 2013 is over. I had so much fun again and hope it wasn't the last one...

Me and Frank van der Linden had a joint session this year: "An XPager's Guide to Process Server-Side Jobs on IBM® Domino®"
<!-- more -->
The first half, we mostly talked about DOTS. The second part was about asynchronous task development for XPages. Slides are below the post:

Demo Database:
--------------

<br />

You can find the demo database I have used to present the idea of asynchronous processing is on Github now:

<https://github.com/sbasegmez/ICONUK2013>

You can also find the full application loaded with lots of sample data (guaranteed that it will be slow!), so you can play with it.

The surprize:
-------------

<br />

Asynchronous processing is something I am really interested in. But I think I couldn't explain why it is so important during the session. So I decided to prepare a screencast and share with David Leedy as a new NotesIn9 Session.

"[**NotesIn9 127: XPages Parallel Processing**](http://notesin9.com/index.php/2013/09/11/notesin9-127-xpages-parallel-processing/)" will be available later today is available now on [NotesIn9.com](http://notesin9.com/) :)
