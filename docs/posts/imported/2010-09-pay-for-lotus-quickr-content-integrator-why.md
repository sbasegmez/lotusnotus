Today I were in IBM's Quickr technical education. Talking about Lotus Quickr Content Integrator reminded me this question. Why do a customer pay for Lotus Quickr Content Integrator?
<!-- more -->
This product provides content integration between Lotus Quickr and other content sources like Teamroom, Sharepoint, Exchange Public Folders or Domino.Doc Document Manager.

It costs over 35K for 100 PVUs; expensive huh? It is like buying 400 Quickr user licenses!

I can understand that a customer may have a Sharepoint site, so large that migration may last several months. You may need a long transition period with coexisted environment.

However, a smaller implementation may be migrated in weeks! 35K for several weeks of migration... We should be promoting migrations towards our product, right?

I searched for entitlements on ibm.com, don't want to make a mistake about it. I couldn't find anything. I cannot even verify that if Domino.Doc licensees are entitled to use Content Integrator as a friend told me today. If I am wrong about it, I'd like to be wrong. Please do not hesitate to correct me :)

My suggestion is to entitle Lotus Quickr customers for a limited time, say 1 month. It may also be bounded by purchasing type (for trading licenses only) or quantity (100 users at least).
