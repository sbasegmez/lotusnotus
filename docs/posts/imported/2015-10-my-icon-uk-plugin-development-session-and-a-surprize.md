I'm back from ICON UK 2015. My fourth UK tour and it was a great conference! Thanks to Tim Clark and his friends for their incredible efforts on the conference.

I had a session again this year. But it was a bit difficult session for many people. I got back and thought about what I can do to make it more useful for other XPages developers. Since I have used Prezi for this session, I decided to add **Voice-Over** to the session :)
<!-- more -->
Here is my "**Embrace your XPages Plugin Super Powers** " session with my own voice. Make it full screen, press play button and have fun :)
