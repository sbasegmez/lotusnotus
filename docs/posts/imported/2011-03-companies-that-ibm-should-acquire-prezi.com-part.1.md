Today, I am starting a new topic...

IBM has an 'excellent' strategy based on acquisitions. This strategy provides a fast growing product portfolio. If you have enough financial power and ability to govern different companies under a large umbrella, 'Growth by Acquisition' would be a great strategy in this market...

However, this is a double-sided sword, as legendary Louis V. Gerstner pointed. Taking over a software company can be problematic if 'brain' men left after the acquisition.

Anyway, this is not my specialty to argue :)

In LUGTR 2011 conference, Ozgur Uckan and Denis Sener made a great presentation, 'Business, Socially'. They basically pointed that while IT industry could not solve its basic phenomenal problems, social business or 'getting social and doing business' may complicate our lives more. This is, however, an 'inevitable' direction we should follow.

Many people astonished about their presentation technique as well. They have used a social presentation tool, [prezi.com](http://prezi.com/). Prezi defines itself as;

> "...Presentations have not evolved much in the 50 years since the slide was invented, but Prezi is changing that. Prezi lets you bring your ideas into one space and see how they relate, helping you and your audience connect. Zoom out to see the big picture and zoom in to see details..."

<br />

At the break, I were chatting with Ozgur. I totally agree with his idea about that mind mapping tool is a 'must' in next generation productivity concept. Prezi connects mind-mapping with a revolutionary presentation technique.

Dear IBM, you need a tool like that :)
